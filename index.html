                <p class="description">We propose a new, provably secure family of lightweight modes for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), called Eevee. The Eevee family has fully parallel decryption, making it suitable for MPC protocols for which the round complexity depends on the complexity of the function they compute. Further, our modes use the lightweight forkcipher primitive that offers fixed-length output expansion and a compact yet parallelizable internal structure.</p>

                <p class="description">The Ascon authenticated encryption scheme has recently been selected as winner of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition. Despite its fame, however, there is no known overall generic security treatment of its mode: most importantly, all earlier related generic security results only use the key to initialize the state and do not take into account key blinding internally and at the end. In this work we present a thorough security analysis of the Ascon mode: we consider multi-user and possibly nonce-misuse security by default, but more importantly, we particularly investigate the role of the key blinding. More technically, our analysis includes an authenticity study in various attack settings. This analysis includes a description of a security model of authenticity under state recovery, that captures the idea that the mode aims to still guarantee authenticity and security against key recovery even if an inner state is revealed to the adversary in some way, for instance through leakage. We prove that Ascon satisfies this security property, thanks to its unique key blinding technique.</p>

                <p class="title">Security of the Ascon Authenticated Encryption Mode in the Presence of Quantum Adversaries (Nathalie Lang)</p>
                <p class="description">We examine the post-quantum security of the Ascon authen-
                    ticated encryption mode. Ascon has gained recognition as the winner
                    in the lightweight category in both the CAESAR and NIST competitions.
                    Despite its classical security analyses, the potential impact of
                    quantum adversaries on Ascon has not yet been explored comprehensively.
                    We present a thorough investigation of Ascon’s security in the
                    setting where the adversary has classical access to the construction but
                    has the possession over a quantum computer and can use it to improve
                    its attack. Utilizing the semi-classical one-way to hiding (O2H) lemma,
                    and by smartly defining a corresponding puncture set tailored to the
                    Ascon mode design, we establish that Ascon achieves security up to ap-
                    proximately \(\min \{2^{c/3} , 2^{k/2} \}\) evaluations, where c is the capacity and k
                    is the key size. Additionally, we discuss the implication of our results for
                    the different variants of Ascon, and compare our results to generic quan-
                    tum attacks against Ascon, including exhaustive key search and state
                    recovery.

                <p class="title">QCB is blindly unforgeable (Jannis Leuther)</p>
                <p class="description">QCB is a proposal for a post-quantum secure, rate-one authenticated
                    encryption with associated data scheme (AEAD) based on
                    classical OCB3 and ΘCB, which are vulnerable against a quantum adversary
                    in the Q2 setting. The authors of QCB prove integrity under
                    plus-one unforgeability, whereas the proof of the stronger definition of
                    blind unforgeability has been left as an open problem. After a short
                    overview of QCB and the current state of security definitions for authentication,
                    this work proves blind unforgeability of QCB. Finally, the
                    strategy of using tweakable block ciphers in authenticated encryption is
                    generalised to a generic blindly unforgeable AEAD model</p>

                <p class="description">Due to the rise of quantum computers and their possibilities of attacks a look was taken into the Authenticated Encryption Associated Data (AEAD) mode Off-Set Two-Round (OTR). By using Simon's algorithm a potential collision forgery attack can be constructed which breaks this authenticated encryption scheme in a post-quantum scenario. Only doubling the key size seems to be insufficient to keep the security of OTR. In this paper, we took a look into classical OTR and different kinds of attacks, proposed a modified version with the usage of tweakable block ciphers to ensure a quantum-secure authenticated encryption mode and proved its post-quantum security.</p>
